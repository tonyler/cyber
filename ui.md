# Retro Arcade Style Guide for UI/Dashboard

This style guide is designed to adapt UI generation prompts to a subtle arcade retro aesthetic, inspired by @cyberneticsorg's clean, functional approach in DeFi and blockchain projects (e.g., Nolus Protocol's modern, efficient interfaces). The goal is to evoke classic arcade vibes—like 1980s video games with pixelated simplicity—without being overly kitschy (no excessive neon glows, flashing lights, or cartoonish elements) or complicated (keep modifications minimal and focused on visual tweaks only).

**Important Rule: Do not alter the layout structure at all.** Maintain the exact header, sidebar, main content grid, cards, charts, filters, and any other structural elements from the original prompt. Only apply changes to colors, corners, backgrounds, and fonts as specified below.

## Colors
Use a restrained palette inspired by retro arcade screens: vibrant but muted primaries with dark backgrounds for contrast. Avoid harsh neons; opt for softened tones to keep it professional and not kitschy.
- **Primary Color**: #FF4500 (Orange-Red, for accents like buttons and highlights—evokes classic arcade fireballs or scores).
- **Secondary Color**: #00BFFF (Deep Sky Blue, for links, icons, or secondary elements—subtle nod to space invaders blues).
- **Background Base**: #1C1C1C (Dark Gray, almost black, for main areas—mimics old CRT screens without glow).
- **Text Color**: #F0F0F0 (Light Gray, for readability on dark backgrounds).
- **Accent Gradients**: Subtle linear gradient from #FF4500 to #00BFFF for hover states or progress bars—use sparingly to avoid complexity.
- **Neutral Tones**: #808080 (Mid Gray) for borders or inactive elements.
